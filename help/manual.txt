==============================

*Carpo* is a reader for RSS/Atom feeds.

== Reading Feeds ==

To read RSS/Atom feeds, select the feed title by clicking on it. This will bring up
a list of available items (stories) from the selected feed. You can then click on any one
of the available story titles to see the detaisl provided by the feed.

At the top of the story display are two buttons. They allow you to browse the link
provided by the feed item, either in the *Carpo* display (click on *Here*), or
in the system browser (click on *Browser*).

== Adding/Editing Feeds ==

=== New Feeds ===
To add a new feed, click on *Maintenance*, then on *New Feed*. This gives you a form with 
feed information, then:

- Enter the feed URL address.
- Click *Check Address* to see if you already have this feed in your list. If
the feed is already known, you will see details displayed in the form.
- If the feed address is not known, click on *Probe Feed*. This will try to
get feed details from the network. Depending on your network speed it can take 
a number of seconds. If your network is not connected, this step won't work.
- Review the data in the form. You can change them here. Of course changing the address means
that you want a different feed.
- When you are happy with the form content, click on *Save Feed*.
- If you do not want any of the changes to take effect, click on *Cancel*.
- If you want to remove the feed, click on *Delete Feed*. Be careful, once the feed is
deleted is cannot be recovered, except by adding it as a new feed. There is no recycle bin.

=== Edit Existing Feeds ===

Find the feed you want to edit in the Feed List display. _Press-and-Hold_ on the feed title.
The Feed Edit form will appear, and you can change any of the feed data.


== Grouping Feeds ==

You can tag feeds with *topics* in the Feed Editor, and select groups with the *Topics*
display from *Views*.

== News Stream ==

Click on *Views* and then *New Stories - On* to see a stream-like list of
new items as they are discovered. This list is updated a few times per minute for one feed
at a time. It is thus not genuine _streaming_, since RSS servers do not push information
to clients.

To bring up a news item, click on the item in the stream, and the display will switch
to the index of that feed and the details of the item.

Do de-select the News Stream, either _Press-and-Hold_ on the News Stream items, or
click *Views* and then *New Stories - Off*.

== Browser ==

You can browse RSS items as well as the web sites that RSS links to with *Carpo*.
Keep in mind that this is an RSS reader, not a full feature browser.

You can drag the web page or RSS content, or you can use keys to move it.

=== Keys ===

Some keys have special meaning:

- *Escape* brings you back to the RSS item after following links.
- *Left*, *Right*, *Up*, *Down* move the web page in the view.
- *Space* moves the web page to the original position.
- *+* and *-* scale the web page up and down.
- *0* brings the web page back to the original scale.
